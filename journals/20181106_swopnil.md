## Selecting the Dataset: Motivations, Goals, Initial Ideas
Author: [Swopnil N. Shrestha](https://github.com/swopnilnep)


To begin our project, we started by searching for the dataset we aimed to investigate on. After some exploration on Kaggle and GitHub in search for datasets, we came across [BuzzFeedNews's](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews) repository to multiple bikeshare companies across various Northeastern US cities. 

We decided to build from the work that BuzzFeedNews had already done and define the goals, motivations and initial ideas for projects that we will be doing.

## Motivation

Bicycles ridership can tell a lot about the accessibility and lifestyle of a city. We wanted to take this project as an opportunity to visualize as well as tell a story through the lives of the bicyclists whose data lives were portrayed in the data. 

## Goals

Collecting data from the data vendors listed below and unifying the features listed into a singular dataset for 4 US cities: __Boston__, __New York City__, __Chicago__ and Washington, D.C. 

The summary of the dataset is listed below:
