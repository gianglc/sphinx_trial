# Starting with Markdown lesson
The hardest part of starting a project is the direction. Everything seems new to me and I have to study everything by my own. My next lesson is Markdown usage. 
## Mardown cheatsheet
There is a list of all markdown syntax:

| Content | Syntax | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Headers | # H1, ## H2, ### H3, #### H4, ##### H5, ###### H6 | 
| Italics | _ underscore _ or * asterisks * | _Italics_ |
|Strong emphasis| __ underscore __ or ** asterisks **| __Strong emphasis__|
|Strikethrough| ~~ Scrath this ~~| ~~Strikethrough~~|
|Ordered list| Use actual number 1., 2., 3.|1. First ordered list items|
|Unordered list| Use - or + at the beggining of the list| 
|Links| URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links| [Google](https://www.google.com)|
|Image|! [alt text] (Link of image)|
|Blockquotes| Use ">" at the beggining of your quote| 

This is the basis syntax list of Markdown. I found Markdown easy and convinent to use to write the journal or text file. I don't have to remember too many syntax to write a markdown file. Thank you Swop for teaching me lots of new things I have never heard :)))
